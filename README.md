# PouchDB IndexedDB Blocked Event Repro

Admittedly I'm doing something weird where I destroy the database instance before replicating.

Regardless, you can see the PouchDB error log "this should never happen" in the browser console when running the frontend.

## Instructions

```
npm install
npm run server
# in another terminal
npm run front
```
